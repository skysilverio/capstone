# Capstone
<body> I attached the Capstone project I completed to graduate. I discuss a security assessment that was performed at a local company. The security assessment primarily focused on different security controls (phyiscal, logical, and administrative) from a security assessment checklist that the company completed. The project is broken down into a summary, review of other work, changes to the proejct environment, methodology, project goals and objectives, project timeline, unanticipated requirements, and project deliverables. </body>

<body> It was my first time conducting a project like this, and it was a huge learning experience. I do have project management experience, as it is a large part of my current job, but it was never focused on IT or security control implementations. </body>
